# Merge locally into `main`, no pull requests

Date: 2026-11-06 · Status: accepted

## Context

The repo has a single author. Pull requests with required checks were the alternative; the author
reviews each task's report and approves it in chat instead.

## Decision

- Each task is developed on a `my-<n>-<slug>` branch, in its own worktree when tasks run in parallel.
- After the author approves, the branch is rebased onto `main`, fast-forward merged locally, checked
  again, and `main` is pushed. No pull requests.
- A CI workflow, where one exists, is a post-push signal, not a merge gate. The pre-merge gate is the
  local checks.

## Consequences

- A red CI run on `main` means `main` is broken: fix it right away with a follow-up commit.
- History stays linear (rebase + `--ff-only`); `main` is never force-pushed.
- The full flow is in `ai/workflow.md`.
